   More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) using HTTPS and MLS
                   draft-ralston-mimi-protocol-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies the More Instant Messaging Interoperability
   (MIMI) protocol, which allows users of different messaging providers
   to share membership in rooms and send messages to one-another.

   More specifically, the MIMI protocol defines message formats and
   conventions that allows the servers of different providers to
   interoperate, leaving the provider-internal client-server
   communication up to the provider.

   To ensure that communications between users are confidential and
   authentic, the MIMI protocol relies on MLS ([RFC9420], through the
   MIMI DS protocol [I-D.robert-mimi-delivery-service]) to protect
   messages end-to-end.

1.  Introduction

   Providers of secure messaging services typically allow their users to
   only communicate with other users of the same provider.  This can be
   limiting for users, who frequently have to run clients of multiple
   messaging applications in parallel, each for a different secure
   messaging provider.

   The More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) protocol specified
   in this document allows interoperability on the provider level based
   on rooms.  Each MIMI protocol room is hosted at a single provider,
   but allows users from different providers to become participants in
   the room.

   Users and providers can use events to interact with the provider
   hosting the room and with one-another, for example, to add or remove
   users from the room.

   Each user can have clients in the room, who can then communicate with
   one-another, where messages are end-to-end encrypted using the
   Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol ([RFC9420]).

   An MLS group (through the MIMI DS protocol
   [I-D.robert-mimi-delivery-service]) forms the cryptographic core of
   each room and ensures that clients in the room agree on room state
   and group state such as user and client level membership.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Terms and definitions are inherited from [I-D.barnes-mimi-arch].

   Throughout this document, the examples use the TLS Presentation
   Language [RFC8446] and the semantics of HTTP [RFC7231] respectively
   as placeholder a set of binary encoding mechanism and transport
   semantics.

      *ISSUE*: Come to consensus on a specific binary encoding for the
      MIMI transport protocol.

      *ISSUE*: Come to consensus on a specific set of MIMI transport
      protocol semantics.

3.  Example protocol flow

   This section shows how three users (Alice, Bob and Cathy) from
   different providers can use the protocol specified in this document
   to join the same room and send messages to one-another.  (Not all of
   these steps are part of the MIMI transport protocol):

   *  Alice get the internal identifier for Bob

   *  Alice gains consent to talk to Bob

   *  Alice fetches initial keying material for Bob's clients

   *  (Alice create a room) †

   *  Alice adds Bob to a room

   *  Alice sends a message to the room

   *  Bob sends a message to the room

   *  The hub/owning provider fans out the message

   *  Bob adds a new client

   *  Alice repeats the first three steps for Cathy

   *  Alice adds Cathy to the room

   *  Alice removes Bob from the room

   Throughout this section, we will detail the individual operations
   through Alice's lens.  All actions by Alice are taken through Alice's
   client and her server's proprietary API.  While some parts of the
   individual messages originate from Alice's clients, the MIMI protocol
   is only concerned with the communication between Alice's, Bob's and
   Cathy's servers.  So whenever users are referenced throughout this
   section, it is implied that they are communicating with their
   respective servers, which then communicate with one-another.

   † as mentioned in the text, creating a room is a local provider
   action, which is out of scope of MIMI.

3.1.  Get internal identifier for Bob

   This is an example/placeholder for a possibly more sophisticated
   discovery mechanism.  It is not intended to be directly implemented.

      *TODO*: Replace with or reference a discovery mechanism with WG
      consensus

      *TODO*: Details will follow once the WG has concensus on
      identifiers, their mapping and their retrieval/discovery.  The
      format of specific identifiers is discussed in
      [I-D.mahy-mimi-identity].  Any specific conventions which are
      needed should be merged into this document.

   Alice obtains Bob's internal identifier.

   Alice fetches the internal identifier for some field of Bob's, in
   this example his handle.

   GET /identifierDiscovery/{domain}

   The request body is described as:

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     handle(1),
     nick(2),
     email(3),
     phone(4),
     partialName(5),
     wholeProfile(6),
     oidcStdClaim(7),
     vcardField(8),
     (255)
   } IdentifierType;

   struct {
     IdentifierType type;
     string searchValue;
     select(type) {
        case oidcStdClaim:
          string claimName;
       case vcardField:
          string fieldName;
     };
   } IdentifierRequest;

   The response body is described as:

   enum {
     success(0),
     notFound(1),
     ambiguous(2),
     forbidden(3),
     unsupportedField(4),
     (255)
   } IdentifierDiscoveryCode;

   struct {
     IdentifierDiscoverCode responseCode;
     IdentifierUri uri;
   } IdentifierResponse;

      *ISSUE*: In the course of discovering Bob, Alice might or might
      not obtain a list of Bob's clients.

3.2.  Fetch initial key material for Bob

   The action attempts to claim initial keying material for all the
   clients of a list of users at a single provider.  The keying material
   may not be reused unless identified as "last resort" keying material.

   Alice sends an Event (framed in a MIMIMessage) of type
   ds.fetch_key_packages to Bob's server, requesting key material for
   each of Bob's clients.

   See Section 5.1 for the definition of Events in general and
   Section 5.3.4.3 for the ds.fetch_key_packages event.

      *TODO*: For now, the event fetches key packages based on client
      identifiers, not user identifiers.  This is because KeyPackage
      fetching is part of MIMI DS, which doesn't know what a user is.
      We could, however, send multiple MIMI DS requests in a single MIMI
      protocol request.

   If the request was successful, the response contains a list of
   KeyPackages, one for each client.

      *TODO*: For now, responses are simple, we can improve granularity
      when we start optimizing.

      *TODO*: Once we have framing for MIMIResponses, add a reference
      here.

3.3.  Create a room

   Creating a room is done between a client and its local provider and
   is out of scope of MIMI.  Since Alice creates the room on the server
   of her local provider, it becomes the Hub for the room.  However, the
   room policy format is in scope for MIMI.  We assume that this room is
   a members-only room, and that only users who have the admin or owner
   role can add and remove users.

   We also assume that Alice has both the owner and admin roles within
   the room.

      *TODO*: Add information on room policy here once we have consensus
      on what that looks like.

3.4.  Alice adds Bob

   Management of the participants list (i.e. the list of users in the
   room) is done through m.room.user events.  To add Bob to the room,
   Alice creates an m.room.user event.  See Section 6.7 for more
   information on user state changes.

   Room state is anchored in the room's underlying MLS group through a
   GroupContext Extension, which mirrors all of the room's state
   variables.

   m.room.user events are MLS proposals, which change the room state
   outside of the MLS group immediately upon reception and align the
   mirror of the room state in the extension (which is part of the group
   state) upon the next ds.commit event.  This reflects the MLS
   proposal-commit paradigm that allows members and external parties to
   propose changes, but only members to commit them.  See Section 5.3.2
   for more information on how the room state is cryptographically
   anchored.

   Alice does not only want to add Bob as a participant, but also Bob's
   client.  To do that, she sends a ds.commit event (Section 5.3.4.2) to
   the group.  As ds.commit events can contain an arbitrary number of
   proposals, Alice includes the m.room.user proposal, as well as a
   proposal to add Bob's client.  She creates the latter by using the
   key material she previously fetched from Bob's server.

   She then sends the resulting ds.commit to the Hub. Upon reception,
   the Hub processes the commit and the proposals therein by updating
   the participant list to include Bob and the underlying MLS group
   state to add Bob's client.

   Finally, the Hub fans out the commit event to Bob.

      *TODO*: Especially when adding new clients, we will want to
      forward a ds.commit event selectively, as existing group members
      will only be interested in the actual commit, whereas new group
      members only need the Welcome.

3.5.  Alice sends a message to the room

   After Bob has joined the room, Alice creates a message using the MIMI
   content format [I-D.ietf-mimi-content], and sends a ds.send_message
   (Section 5.3.4.5) event to the Hub.

3.6.  The hub/owning provider fans out the message

   If the Hub accepts the message it fans the message out to all guest
   servers, which in this case is Bob's server.

   Generally, the Hub also fans out any messages which originate from
   itself (ex: removing clients of deleted users).

3.7.  Bob sends a message to the room

   This is no different from Alice sending a message, which is fanned
   out in exactly the same way.

3.8.  Bob adds a new client

   For Bob's new client to join the MLS group and therefore fully
   participate in the room with Alice, Bob needs to fetch the current
   group and room information through a ds.fetch_group_info event
   (Section 5.3.4.4), which he sends to the Hub.

      *TODO*: in the MLS case, what security properties are needed to
      protect a GroupInfo object in the MIMI context are still under
      discussion.  It is possible that the requester only needs to prove
      possession of their private key.  The GroupInfo in another context
      might be sufficiently sensitive that it should be encrypted from
      the end client to the hub provider (unreadable by the local
      provider).

   The new client can use the information to add itself to the group via
   a ds.commit that contains an MLS ExternalInit proposal.

3.9.  Alice adds Cathy

   Alice gets the identifier for Cathy and waits for her to join the
   room in exactly the same way as in previous steps.

3.10.  Alice removes Bob from the room

   Alice removes Bob by sending an ds.commit event.  The ds.commit event
   contains an m.room.user event which removes Bob from the participant
   list, as well as proposals to remove Bob's clients.

4.  Framing

   MIMI protocol messages are sent described using the TLS presentation
   language format (Section 3 of [RFC8446]).

   All MIMI protocol messages are framed by a MIMIMessage.

   enum {
      reserved(0),
      mimi10(1), // MIMI 1.0
      (65535)
   } ProtocolVersion;

   enum {
      reserverd(0),
      event(1),
      event_response(2),
   } MIMIMessageType;

   struct {
      // The protocol version this event is created for.
      ProtocolVersion version;

      // The room ID where the event is sent in context of.
      opaque roomId;

      // Who or what sent this event. For example, a user ID.
      opaque sender;

      MIMIMessageType message_type;
      select (MIMIMessage.message_type) {
         case event:
           Event event;
         case event_response:
           EventResponse response;
      }
   } MIMIMessage

5.  Rooms and Events

   Rooms, described by [I-D.barnes-mimi-arch], consist of a user
   participation list, a cryptographic representation of the room as
   defined by [I-D.robert-mimi-delivery-service], policy, and other
   metadata as needed.

      *TODO*: Consider renaming "event" to something else.

   A room's state is modified, used, and retrieved through _events_.
   Some events are fanned out to other participating servers while other
   events are operations performed exclusively with the hub server for a
   room.

   Events that change the state of the room are implemented through MLS
   proposals as defined in [RFC9420], thus allowing the underlying MIMI
   DS protocol to anchor the current room state cryptographically.  MLS
   proposals are signed, allowing every recipient in their path to
   verify their authenticity.

   This document defines additional events to encapsulate MIMI DS
   protocol messages, for example, to add clients to a room's underlying
   MLS group or to request single-use key material for another user's
   clients.

   Events carry information, and are not required to be persisted.  The
   current participation and policy state is confirmed by the
   cryptographic security layer rather than being confirmed in events
   specifically.

5.1.  Event Schema

   Events are validated against their TLS presentation language format
   (Section 3 of [RFC8446]):

   // See the "MIMI Event Types" IANA registry for values.
   // Example: "m.room.info"
   opaque EventType;

   struct {
      // The event type.
      EventType type;

      // Additional fields may be present as dependent on event type.
      select (Event.type) {
         case "m.room.user":
            // MLSMessage containing a UserEvent proposal
            MLSMessage user_event_proposal;
         case "ds.proposal":
            DSRequest ds_proposal;
         case "ds.commit":
            DSRequest ds_commit;
         case "ds.fetch_key_packages":
            DSRequest fetch_key_packages;
         case "ds.fetch_group_info":
            DSRequest fetch_group_info;
         case "ds.send_message":
            DSRequest send_message;
         // more cases as required by registry
      }
   } Event;

      *TODO*: Consider splitting sender into an object of {type,
      identifier}.

      *TODO*: The sender field might be a bit redundant now that
      signaling is largely handled through MLS proposals.

   Note an "event ID" is not specified on the struct.  Events are sent
   ephemerally and confirmed by the underlying cryptographic group state
   rather than referenced by a consistent identifier.

   The "origin server" of an event is the server implied by the sender
   field.

   Recipients of an event respond with a MIMIMessage of type
   event_response.

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     ok(1),
     key_package(2),
     group_info(3),
     error(4),
   } EventResponseType

   enum {
     // TODO
   } EventErrorType

   struct {
     EventErrorType type;

      select (EventResponse.type) {
         // TODO
      }
   } EventError

   struct {
      EventResponseType type;

      // Additional fields may be present as dependent on event type.
      select (EventResponse.type) {
         case ok:
            struct {};
         case key_package:
            DSResponse key_package;
         case group_info:
            DSResponse group_info;
         case error:
            EventError error;
      }
   } EventResponse

5.2.  Room state

   The state of a room consists of the room's RoomID, its policy, and
   the participant list (including the role and participation state of
   each participant).  Also associated with the room is the MLS group
   managed by the MIMI DS protocol, which anchors the room state
   cryptographically as part of the group state.

   While (through the MIMI DS protocol) all parties involved in a room
   agree on the room's state, the Hub is the arbiter that decides if a
   state change is valid.  All state-changing events are sent to the
   Hub, checked for their validity and policy conformance before they
   are forwarded to any follower servers.

   As soon as the Hub accepts an event that changes the room state, its
   effect is applied to the room state and future events are validated
   in the context of that new state.

   The room state is thus changed based on events, even if the MLS
   proposal implementing the event was not yet committed by a client.
   Note that this only applies to events changing the room state, but
   not for MIMI DS specific events that change the group state.  For
   more information on the proposal-commit paradigm and the role of the
   MIMI DS protocol see Section 5.3.

5.3.  Cryptographic room representation

   Each room is represented cryptographically by an MLS group and the
   Hub that manages the room uses the MIMI DS protocol specified in
   [I-D.robert-mimi-delivery-service] to manage that group.

   In particular, the MIMI DS protocol manages the list of group
   members, i.e. the list of clients belonging to users currently in the
   room.

5.3.1.  Proposal-commit paradigm

   The MIMI DS protocol uses MLS, which follows a proposal-commit
   paradigm.  Any party involved in a room (follower server, Hub or
   clients) can send proposals (e.g. to add/remove/update clients of a
   user or to re-initialize the group with different parameters).
   However, only clients can send commits, which contain all valid
   previously sent proposals and apply them to the MLS group state.

   The MIMI DS protocol ensures that the Hub, all follower servers and
   the clients of all participants (or at least those in the join state)
   agree on the group state, which includes the client list and the key
   material used for message encryption (although the latter is only
   available to clients).  Since the group state also includes a copy of
   the room state at the time of the most recent commit, it is also
   covered by the agreement.

5.3.2.  Cryptographically anchoring room state

   To allow all parties involved to agree on the state of the room in
   addition to the state of the associated group, the room state is
   anchored in the MLS group via a GroupContext extension.

   struct {
      opaque user_id;
      opaque role;
      ParticipationState state;
   } ParticipantData

   struct {
     opaque room_id;
     ParticipantData participants<V>;
     // TODO: Add any remaining room data
   } RoomState;

   As part of the MIMI DS protocol, clients create commits to update the
   group state, which are then included in MIMI DS specific events.  The
   time between two commits denotes an epoch.

   Whenever a client creates a commit, it MUST include all valid
   proposals accepted by the Hub during the current epoch.  This
   includes both proposals that carry room-state changes, as well as
   proposals sent as part of MIMI DS events.

   Note that the validity of a proposal depend on the current room
   state, which may change during an epoch based on room-state changing
   events.  The changes of these events are applied to the room state
   even if the commits that carry the event information have not yet
   been committed.

5.3.3.  Authenticating proposals

   The MLS specification [RFC9420] requires that MLS proposals from the
   Hub and from follower servers (external senders in MLS terminology)
   be authenticated using key material contained in the external_senders
   extension of the MLS group.  Each MLS group associated with a MIMI
   room MUST therefore contain an external_senders extension.  That
   extension MUST contain at least the Certificate of the Hub.

   When a user from a follower server becomes a participant in the room,
   the Certificate of the follower server MAY be added to the extension.
   When the last participant belonging to a follower server leaves the
   room, the certificate of that user MUST be removed from the list.
   Changes to the external_senders extension only take effect when the
   MLS proposal containing the event is committed by a MIMI DS commit.
   See Section 6.7 for more information.

5.3.4.  MIMI DS events

   The MIMI DS protocol operations are encapsulated in DSRequest structs
   and contain a request_type field that details the operation in
   question.  To disambiguate MIMI DS operations on the event-level,
   each operation is assigned its own distinct event type.

   The MIMI DS protocol deals with authentication of each request and
   upon successful processing returns a DSResponse to be sent to the
   sender of the event, optionally an MLSMessage for full fan-out and
   optionally one or more Welcome messages for fan-out to individual
   follower servers.

   Depending on the event, a DSResponse either indicates successful
   processing, the requested data (e.g. group information required for
   joins), or an error message.

   Messages meant for fan-out are DSFanoutRequests, which contain an MLS
   message, as well as information to which clients messages should be
   fanned out to.

      *TODO*: Update the MIMI DS doc to allow for messages to contain
      more than one proposal and a generic "commit" action.

5.3.4.1.  Propose group update

   *Event type*: ds.proposal

   Group members, the Hub, and follower servers can use this event to
   propose updates to the group.  Each such event contains one or more
   proposals that can be committed to update the state of the MLS group
   associated with the room.  In particular, this event can be used to
   add, remove or update clients in the group.

   struct {
     DSRequest proposal;
   } DSProposal

   *Additional validation rules*:

   *  Clients can only be added to the group if the associated user is
      on the participant list and in the join state.

5.3.4.2.  Commit group update

   *Event type*: ds.commit

   Group members can use this event to commit any pending proposals
   (including both group updates and room updates).  The sender of this
   event can include additional group updates without proposing them
   separately through the ds.proposal event.

   Note that this event can also be used by a client to add itself to
   the group.  To do that, the sender requires the current group
   information (see Section 5.3.4.4).

   struct {
     DSRequest commitBundle;
   } DSCommit

   *Additional validation rules*:

   *  Clients can only be added to the group if the associated user is
      on the participant list and in the join state.

5.3.4.3.  Fetch KeyPackage

   *Event type*: ds.fetch_key_packages

      *TODO*: For now, we assume that KeyPackages are fetched directly,
      i.e. not in the context of a room and via a Hub. This might change
      in the future.  If it does change, this event needs an additional
      authentication mechanism.

   Group members can use this event to request a KeyPackage from the Hub
   or another follower server.

   struct {
     DSRequest fetch_key_packages;
   } DSFetchKeyPackages

   *Additional validation rules*:

   None

5.3.4.4.  Fetch group information

   *Event type*: ds.fetch_group_info

   Group members or follower servers can use this event to request group
   information from the Hub. Up-to-date group information is required
   for clients to be able to add themselves to a group via the ds.commit
   event.  The group info returned to the sender includes any pending
   proposals.

   struct {
     DSRequest fetch_group_info;
   } DSFetchGroupInfo

   *Additional validation rules*:

   None

5.3.4.5.  Send Message

   *Event type*: ds.send_message

      *TODO*: This is not a proposal and there is no way for the Hub or
      follower servers to authenticate this event at the moment.  We
      might want to a way to do that later.

   Group members can use this event to request to send an encrypted
   (application) message to the other group members.

   struct {
     DSRequest send_message;
   } DSSendMessage

   *Additional validation rules*:

   None

5.4.  Creation

   Rooms (and the underlying MLS groups) are first created within the
   provider, out of scope from MIMI.  When the room is exposed to
   another server over the MIMI protocol, such as with an explicit
   invite to another user, the creating server MUST produce the
   following details:

   *  An m.room.info (Section 5.4.1) event describing the encryption and
      policy details for the room.

   *  A universally unique room ID (represented by the room info event).

   *  An m.room.user (Section 6.7) event which invites the desired user.

   *  Any relevant cryptographic state needed to verify the invite is
      legitimate.  For example, the ciphersuite used by the
      cryptographic security layer.

   This is the minimum state required by a MIMI room.  Room creators MAY
   wish to include additional details in the initial state, such as
   configuration of the room's policy, adding the creator's other
   clients to the MLS group state, etc.

5.4.1.  m.room.info

   The m.room.info event contains the current room state, thus allowing
   servers to bootstrap the room.  Note that this event does not contain
   any of the cryptographic state of the underlying MIMI DS group.
   Clients that want to join a room need to use a ds.fetch_group_info
   event to obtain the information required to join the room.

   *Event type*: m.room.info

   *Additional event fields*:

   struct {
     RoomState room_state;
   } InfoEvent;

      *TODO*: Include fields for policy information (previously called a
      "policy ID" in ralston-mimi-signaling).

   *Fanout considerations*:

   InfoEvent is _unsigned_ in all cases it is used, but authenticated
   implicitly through the transport layer (Section 7).  The room info
   event is used during invites to ensure the server is capable of
   participating in the room and is not fanned out more generally.  See
   Section 7.3.2 for usage.

6.  User Participation and Client Membership

   In a MIMI room, users are _participants_ with an associated
   _participation state_ whereas clients of those users are _members_ of
   the cryptographic state.  The user's participation state is updated
   concurrent to or before changes are made to the cryptographic state.

   Users will always exist in one of the following participation states:

   enum {
      invite,  // "Invited" state.
      join,    // "Joined" state.
      ban,     // "Banned" state.
      knock,   // "Knocking" state.
   } ParticipationState;

   These states allow a user to remain logically "joined" to the
   conversation when they have zero encryption-capable clients
   available.  The user will not be able to see messages sent while they
   had no clients, but can add their clients to the cryptographic state
   at any time.  A user with zero clients in the cryptographic state is
   considered to be an _inactive participant_. Users with one or more
   clients in the cryptographic state are _active participants_.

   All servers with at least one user of theirs in the "joined"
   participation state are considered to be "in" or "participating" in
   the room.  Events which require full fanout (Section 7.3.1.1) are
   sent to all participating servers by default.  Some events MAY be
   sent to additional servers as needed by their fanout considerations.

   The participant list is anchored in the cryptographic state of the
   room as described in Section 5.3.2.

6.1.  Adds

      *TODO*: We will probably want some kind of mechanism here that
      allows the adder to signal that they are authorized (by the added
      user) to add the added user to the room.

   An _add_ is when a user adds another user to the list of participants
   in the _join_ state.  The m.room.user event that effects this change
   is typically sent as part of a commit that also adds the user's
   clients to the room's MLS group.

   1.  The adder generates an m.room.user (Section 6.7) event to add the
       target user.

   2.  The adder sends (Section 7.3.1) the m.room.user event to the hub
       server.  If the adder is a client, the event is likely sent as
       part of a ds.commit event.

   3.  The hub server validates the event to ensure the following:

       *  The target user of the add MUST NOT already be in the banned
          or joined states.

       *  The sender of the invite MUST already be in the joined state.

   4.  If the event is invalid, it is rejected.  Otherwise, it is
       forwarded by the hub to the servers of all participants in the
       joined state.  This includes the server of the user added by the
       event.

   5.  The target user (or its server) can reject the addition by
       sending an m.room.user event that proposes the removal of the
       user and its clients (Section 6.4).

6.2.  Invites

   An _invite_ is when a user (or more specifically, a user's client)
   adds another user to the list of participants in the invite state.

   Once the user is on the participant list (and has been notified of
   this fact by the Hub), one of the user's clients can add itself, as
   well as any other clients to the room's underlying group.

   Updating the target user's participation state is done using the
   following steps, and is visualized in Figure 1.

   1.  The inviter's server generates an m.room.user (Section 6.7) event
       to invite the target user.  Typically this begins with a client-
       initiated request to the server using the provider-specific API.

   2.  The inviter's server sends (Section 7.3.1) the m.room.user event
       to the hub server.

   3.  The hub server validates the event to ensure the following:

       *  The target user of the invite MUST NOT already be in the
          banned or joined states.

       *  The sender of the invite MUST already be in the joined state.

   4.  If the event is invalid, it is rejected.  Otherwise, it is
       forwarded by the hub to the target user's server to give it the
       opportunity to reject the invite early in the process.  This is
       described by Section 7.3.2.

   5.  If the target server rejected the event, the event is rejected by
       the hub as well.  Otherwise, the event is fanned out
       (Section 7.3.1.1) to all participating servers, plus the target
       server if not already participating.

   At this stage, the _user_ is now invited but their clients are not
   members of the cryptographic state.  The invite is delivered to the
   target's clients through relevant provider-specific API where the
   user can then accept or decline the invite.

   If the user declines the invite, they are removed from the
   participant list.  Accepting is done by joining (Section 6.3) the
   room.

                       Figure 1: Invite happy path

6.3.  Joins

   Users join a room either in response to an invite (therefore
   accepting it) or after discovering it as a public room.  In both
   cases, the user first updates their participation state before the
   cryptographic security layer is engaged to add their clients.  Note
   that both of these actions can be performed either sequentially, or
   through a single ds.commit event.

      *TODO*: Describe policy considerations for what makes a room
      "public".

      *TODO*: Move the following paragraph to the MIMI DS subsection
      describing ds.commit.

   A user already in the join participation state MAY add and remove
   their own clients from the cryptographic state at will.  Clients are
   unable to remove themselves via ds.commit, however they are able to
   propose that they be removed in the next commit via ds.proposal.

   The joining user can follow one of two flows.  Either it first
   updates the participation state and then adds their clients, or it
   perfoms both actions in the same event.

   The two-step flow looks as follows:

   1.  Option a: The joiner's server generates an m.room.user
       (Section 6.7) event to add the user.

       Option b: The joiner's client generates a commit that contains an
       m.room.user event, as well as an Add proposal for itself (this
       requires that the client has previously obtained a the room's
       group info through a ds.fetch_group_info event
       (Section 5.3.4.4)).  The joiner's server generates a ds.commit
       event from the commit.

   2.  The joiners's server sends (Section 7.3.1) the generated event to
       the hub server.

   3.  The hub server validates the event to ensure the following:

       *  The joining user MUST NOT already be in the banned from the
          room.

       *  The sender and joining user MUST be the same.

   4.  If the event is invalid, it is rejected.  Otherwise, the event is
       fanned out (Section 7.3.1.1) to all participating servers, plus
       the joiner's server as they are now participating in the room
       too.

   If the user was added to the room via a standalone m.room.user event,
   the user's clients are able to add themselves to the cryptographic
   group state via one or more ds.commit events after fetching the
   room's current information via a ds.fetch_group_info event.

6.4.  Leaves/Kicks

   Leaving a room can signal a user declining an invite, voluntarily
   leaving the room, or being kicked (removed) from the room.  When the
   sender and target of an m.room.user (Section 6.7) leave event are
   different, the target user is being kicked.  Otherwise the event
   represents a voluntary leave or declined invite (if the previous
   participation state was "invited").

   Like with other participation/membership operations, a user's leave
   is initiated by updating their participation state first.  This is
   done by sending (Section 7.3.1) the relevant m.room.user
   (Section 6.7) state event to the hub, which validates it as follows:

   *  If the target and sender are the same, the user MUST be in the
      invited, joined, or knocking participation state.

   *  Otherwise:

      -  The target user of the kick MUST be in the joined participation
         state.

      -  The sender for a kick MUST be in the joined participation
         state.

      *TODO*: Include special case permissions constraints.

   If the event is valid, it is fanned out (Section 7.3.1.1) to all
   particpating servers, plus the target user's server.

   The next ds.commit event MUST remove _all_ of the target user's
   clients.  If multiple users leave the room, all of their clients MUST
   be removed in the same operation.  Other cryptographically-relevant
   changes MAY be committed alongside the removals, however the
   operation MUST at a minimum remove the affected clients.

   The hub server MAY be permitted to generate the needed changes to
   remove the affected clients, requiring that those changes be
   confirmed/accepted by a client remaining in the group promptly.

   As mentioned in Section 6.3, a user already in the join participation
   state MAY add and remove their own clients from the cryptographic
   state at will.

6.5.  Bans

   Bans imply kick, and are operated the same way as Section 6.4, though
   with the m.room.user (Section 6.7) state event using a ban
   participation state.

   In contrast to leaving users, banned users remain on the participant
   list in the ban state.

   An added exception on the validation is also applied to permit
   preemptive bans: the target user is not required to be in the joined
   state to allow the participation state change.

   Unbans can be performed by removing a user in the banned
   participation state from the participant list Section 6.4.

6.6.  Knocks

   In this state, the sender of a knock is requesting an invite
   (Section 6.2) to the room.  They do not have access to the
   cryptographic state.

      *TODO*: Discuss if this participation state is desirable, and
      figure out details for how it works.  It'd likely just be an
      m.room.user state event with no MLS interaction, like invites are.

      *TODO*: If we have an Add event as discussed in a TODO in the
      "Invites" section, an "Add" would probably be the response to a
      knock.

6.7.  m.room.user

   *Event type*: m.room.user

   An m.room.user event can be used to change the participation state of
   a user.

      *TODO*: Do we also want this to be able to change a participant's
      role?

   It is transported via an MLS proposal of type UserEvent.  If the
   event adds a user to the room and it is the first user in the room
   that belongs to the sending follower server, the UserEvent MAY
   contain the Certificate that can be used to validate external
   proposals from that follower server.  If it does, the commit that
   contains the proposal adds the Certificate to external_senders
   extension of the underlying MLS group.

   If the event removes the last user of a follower server from a room,
   the commit that contains the MLS proposal that carries the event
   removes the Certificate of that follower server from the extension.

      *TODO*: This proposal needs to be added to the IANA proposal list,
      or specified as an extension proposal as specified in the MLS
      extensions document.  We might want to have one MIMIProposal type
      that in turn can encapsulate more than just this event.

   enum {
      invite,
      join,
      leave,
      ban,
      knock,
   } ParticipationStateChange;

   struct {
      // The user ID being affected by this participation state change.
      opaque targetUserId;

      // The new participation state for the target user. "Leave" removes
      // the user from the list.
      ParticipationStateChange state;

      // Optional human-readable reason for the change. Typically most
      // useful on bans and knocks.
      opaque [[reason]];
      optional<Certificate> follower_server_certificate;
   } UserEvent;

   *Additional validation rules*:

   *  Rules described by Section 6.2, Section 6.3, Section 6.4,
      Section 6.5, Section 6.6.

   *  The proposal MUST be authenticated as an MLS message based on the
      room's underlying MLS group.

      *TODO*: Include validation rules for permissions.

   *Fanout considerations*:

   Each m.room.user event is fanned out as normal (Section 7.3.1.1).
   The event MAY be sent to additional servers, as required by
   Section 6.2, Section 6.3, Section 6.4, Section 6.5, Section 6.6.

   *Additional validation rules*:

   None.

   *Fanout considerations*:

   This event is not fanned out.

7.  Transport

   Servers communicate with each other over HTTP [RFC9110] by "sending"
   events (Section 5.1) to each other.  Responses are also events for
   ease of handling.

7.1.  Authentication

   All endpoints, with the exception of .well-known endpoints, use the
   mutually authenticated mode of TLS [RFC5246].  This provides
   guarantees that each server is speaking to an expected party.

      *TODO*: More information specific to how TLS should be used, i.e.
      mandate best practices that make sense in a mutually authenticated
      scenario that involves two WebPKI based certificates.

   Individual events MAY transit between multiple servers.  TLS provides
   point-to-point security properties while an event's signature
   provides authenticity over multiple hops.

7.2.  Endpoint Discovery

   A messaging provider that wants to query the endpoint of another
   messaging provider first has to discover the fully qualified domain
   name it can use to communicate with that provider.  It does so by
   performing a GET request to https://example.org/.well-known/mimi/
   domain. example.org could, for example, answer by providing the
   domain mimi.example.org (assuming that this is where it responds to
   the REST endpoints defined in Section 7.3).

   The expected response format is simply a text/plain body containing
   the fully qualified domain name.

   GET https://example.org/.well-known/mimi/domain

   Response
   mimi.example.org

7.3.  REST Endpoints

   The following REST endpoints can be used to communicate with a MIMI
   server.

   All operations rely on TLS-encoded structs and therefore requests and
   responses SHOULD use a Content-Type of application/octet-stream.

7.3.1.  Send Event

   Asks the server to send an event (Section 5.1).  Each event is
   subject to additional validation and handling within this endpoint,
   such as ensuring the room's policy is not violated.

   Follower servers in a room MUST only send to the hub server.  The hub
   server is responsible for further fanout (Section 7.3.1.1) if
   required by the event, after the send request has been completed.

   Follower servers receiving an event from another follower server MUST
   reject the request with a 400 HTTP status code.  The hub server MUST
   validate the event according to the event's rules, then perform any
   additional actions on the event as required by the event.  For
   example, the hub server may check that an invite is legal under the
   room's policy, then ensure the target server accepts the event with
   Section 7.3.2, then finally continue processing.

   Rejected send requests MUST return a 400 HTTP status code.  Accepted
   send requests MUST return a 200 HTTP status code, and an event in the
   response body if one is applicable.

   If the event requires fanout (Section 7.3.1.1), the event is then
   fanned out Section 7.3.1.1 to relevant servers in the room.

   Follower servers SHOULD apply the same validation as hub servers upon
   receiving a send request to identify potentially malicious hub
   servers.

   POST /send
   Content-Type: application/octet-stream

   Body
   TLS-serialized Event

   Response
   TLS-serialized Event, or empty if no useful event.

   Servers SHOULD retry this request with exponential backoff (to a
   limit) if they receive timeout/network errors.

7.3.1.1.  Fanout

   A hub server fans an event out by using the send endpoint described
   above on all participating servers in the room.  A server is
   considered "participating" if it has at least one user in the joined
   participation state, described by Section 6.

   Additional servers MAY have the event sent to them if required by the
   steps leading up to fanout.

7.3.2.  Check Invite Event

      *TODO*: Consider reducing this down to m.room.check_invite or
      something, to reuse /send.

   Used by the hub server to ensure a follower server can (and is
   willing to) process an incoming invite.  The called server MAY use
   this opportunity to ensure the inviting user has general consent to
   invite the target user.  For example, ensuring the invite does not
   appear spammy in nature and if the inviter already has a connection
   with the invitee.

   If the server does not recognize the event format of the InfoEvent
   (Section 5.4.1) event, or does not understand the policy/encryption
   configuration contained within, it MUST reject the request.

   The request MAY be rejected with a 400 HTTP status code.  If
   everything looks OK to the server, it responds with a 200 HTTP status
   code.

   struct {
      // The `m.room.user` invite event.
      Event invite;

      // The room creation information.
      InfoEvent roomInfo;
   } CheckInviteRequest;

      *TODO*: If we plan to keep this as an independent request, it will
      need a protocol version field.

POST /check-invite
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

Body
TLS-serialized CheckInviteRequest

Response
Any meaningful information. The pass/fail is identified by the HTTP response
status code, not the response body.

   The hub server SHOULD consider a network error as a rejection.  It is
   expected that the original sender will attempt to re-send the invite
   once the server is reachable again.

8.  Security Considerations

   Overall, the user participation state leads any possible MLS group
   state to ensure malicious clients are not able to easily get access
   to messages.

      *TODO*: Other security guarantees?  Consensus may be required
      here.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created the following registries:

   *  MIMI Event Types

9.1.  MIMI Event Types

   An event type denotes the nature of a payload contained in an event,
   in the context of the MIMI protocol.  The event type is a string
   composed of substrings separated by dots.

   The first substring is "m", followed by the logical container being
   affected (typically just "room"), then a number of descriptor
   strings.

   Example: m.room.info

      *TODO*: Does IANA need any other information for legal event
      types?
