1.  Introduction

   *TODO*: Introduction

2.  Rooms

   Described by [I-D.barnes-mimi-arch], rooms have state which track the
   policy, user participation list, and other metadata.  The room
   additionally contains an MLS group for actual conversation flows.

   Everything in a room is described as a signaling event.  Room state
   information is transmitted as a "state event".  Each event contains
   exactly 1 datum.

   *TODO*: Talk about history, event chaining, etc.

   *TODO*: Talk about event format.

   *TODO*: Talk about where rooms are persisted.

3.  TODO: Scenario content

   Incorporate scenario flows.

   Alice adds Bob:

   1.  Alice creates room.

   2.  Alice signals invite for Bob.

   3.  Hub server (Alice's) contacts Bob's server and sends invite.

   4.  Bob's server checks that it is capable of participating.

   5.  Bob's clients receive invite.

   6.  Later: Bob's client accepts invite by sending a join signaling
       event through the hub to all other participants.

   7.  Bob's client retrieves GroupInfo.

   8.  Bob creates and sends an external commit through the hub.

   Alice adds Bob (alternative):

   1.  Alice creates room.

   2.  Alice discovers all of Bob's clients.

   3.  Alice prepares Welcome messages, attaches them to a signaling
       join event for Bob.

   4.  That package is sent via the hub to Bob's server.

   5.  Bob's server verifies it is capable of participating.

   6.  Bob's server acks the request as OK, informs Bob that they're now
       joined and delivers accompanying Welcome messages.

   7.  Concurrent to the ack, hub fans out the join.

   8.  Bob is now both a participant and a member.

   Alice leaves:

   1.  Alice proposes self-eviction via remove proposals.

   2.  Alice leaves via signaling event.

   3.  Hub requires Alice's proposals to be committed next.

   Alice leaves (alternative):

   1.  Alice leaves via signaling event.

   2.  Hub (or any other member) generates remove proposals for Alice.

   3.  Hub requires those proposals to be committed next.

4.  Participation

   *TODO*:

   *  In general case, signaling leads encryption

   *  Skip policy and consent for now

5.  Membership

   *TODO*:

   *  MLS

6.  Transport

   *TODO*: This section.  Or do we imply it throughout?

7.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

8.  Security Considerations

   *TODO*: Probably more words. (or imply throughout)

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

   *TODO*: This needs content.
